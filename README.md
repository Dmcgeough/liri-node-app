# liri-node-app
This was one of the first heavy server side apps we created where we would delve deep into node.JS in order to complete. In fact nearly the whole assignment could only be used through node.JS. It allowed a user to enter a movie, song or twitter account and see all of the pertinent information for the searched for medium. First we created the node.JS server and installed the necessary NPM packages so that it could communicate with twitter, spotify, and OMDB. Then I created commands for node so that it would recognize which API it was trying to access and what it was searching for. It also needed to know what information to return becasue I did not want it to display information that was either redundant, superflous, or not needed. Then I needed to stringify the results so that they would be readable to anyone using the app. One of the hardest parts was establishing the correct keys so Liri could get access to everything which took some serious work. This assignment represented our transition from client side to server side.
Tools used: API, JavaScript, NPM, Node.JS.
